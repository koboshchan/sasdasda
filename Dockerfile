# Prod image for SecureCord: client + server are both built here, so the
# only thing shipped in the final stage is compiled/bundled JS - no
# TypeScript source, no npx/tsx, no node_modules. Build context is the repo
# root (docker-compose.yml's `build.context: .`) because both client/ and
# server/ need to be reachable from a single build.

# ---- Stage 1: build the static client bundle ----
FROM node:22-alpine AS client-builder
WORKDIR /app/client
COPY client/package.json client/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY client/ ./
RUN npm run build
# Produces client/dist/{index.html,bundle.js,bundle.js.map}

# ---- Stage 2: bundle the server into a single CJS file ----
FROM node:22-alpine AS server-builder
WORKDIR /app/server
COPY server/package.json server/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY server/ ./
# --format=cjs (not esm) is required, not stylistic: mongodb and ws
# require() a handful of optional native addons (kerberos, snappy,
# @mongodb-js/zstd, aws4, socks, @aws-sdk/credential-providers,
# gcp-metadata, mongodb-client-encryption, bufferutil, utf-8-validate)
# inside try/catch, none of which are installed here. Under CJS a missing
# require() stays a caught runtime error exactly like it would unbundled;
# under ESM, esbuild would need to statically resolve those imports at
# build time and fail. --external keeps esbuild from trying to bundle them
# so the try/catch fallback behavior is preserved.
