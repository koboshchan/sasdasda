// A challenge is a self-describing, HMAC-authenticated string:
//   `${op}.${expiresAtMs}.${randomHex}.${hmacHex}`
// where hmacHex = HMAC-SHA256(secret, `${op}.${expiresAtMs}.${randomHex}`).
// Issuing a challenge therefore stores NOTHING server-side - the server can
// hand out an unlimited number of challenges for free without growing any
// in-memory state. (The previous Map-based design stored every issued
// challenge for 5 minutes regardless of whether it was ever solved: pulling
// 20,000 challenges took ~4s and zero cost of the caller's own, an
// unauthenticated memory-exhaustion vector against the anti-abuse mechanism
// itself.)
//
// The client still just counts up in hex, appending its guess as a string
// onto the whole opaque challenge, exactly as before - solving is unchanged
// and needs no protocol update, only a longer opaque string.
//
// Single-use enforcement (so a captured *valid* solution can't be replayed)
// only records challenges that were actually, successfully solved - i.e.
// memory use is bounded by real attacker CPU work, not by how many
// challenges they merely requested. That's what makes it self-limiting by
// construction rather than needing a separate cap.
